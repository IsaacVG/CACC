Open Source Overview
============================
CACC VISSIM 2.0 Algorithm is designed to simulate close-spaced CACC platoons in VISSIM using the COM interface and VISSIM API.
This application can be used to evaluate the operational benefits of having a dedicated CACC lane on freeway.
Need Visual Studio 2013 and VISSIM version 6.22 or newer (both 32 and 64 bit versions work) to run the algorithm.

License information
-------------------
No license needed.


System Requirements
-------------------------

The CACC VISSIM 2.0 Algorithm can run on most standard Window based computers with 
Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the 
amount of data being read into the software.

The CACC VISSIM 2.0 Algorithm was developed using C# (VISSIM COM code) and C++ (VISSIM API code).
Currently this application only runs on Windows operating systems, due to limitations of VISSIM.
