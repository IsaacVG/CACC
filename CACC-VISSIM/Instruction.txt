Steps to run the CACC VISSIM 2.0 Algorithm

1) Compile the Type101DriverModel and Type104DriverModel into DLL files.
   either 32 or 64 bit, depending on the PTV VISSIM version. 
2) Open the I-66_wb_dedicatedcacclane_2.inpx, change the driver models of vehicle
   type 101 and 104 to the compiled DLL files in step 1).
3) Design your own simulation scenarios, and modify the scenarios_template.csv file.

	Metadata of scenarios_template.csv:

	GPVOL%: 		Inflation rate of General-Purpose demand
	HOVVol%:		Inflation rate of HOV demand
	CACCMP_GP: 		CACC market penetration of general-purpose vehicles
	CACCMP_HOV: 		CACC market penetration of HOV vehicles
	Toggle:			Just use 2. This is for debugging purposes.
	#Max Platoon Size:	Maximum platoon size. CACCHWLong is used for the platoon head.
	CACCHWShort:		Headway among vehicles within a platoon
	CACCHWLong:		Headway between leading platoon tail and following platoon head.
	LeadingCriticalGap:	Lane-changing critical gap between the ego and leading vehicle
	LaggingCriticalGap:	Lane-changing critical gap between the ego and lagging vehicle
	LeadingSpdDiff:		Lane-changing max speed differential between the ego and leading vehicle
	LaggingSpdDiff:		Lane-changing max speed differential between the ego and lagging vehicle
4) Use the CACC_COM_Controller (Visual Studio 2013) to start the simulations.
	Select "Multi-Scenario Mode",
	Specify the path of the needed files (inpx, layx, csv, etc)
	Change simulation time, replications and random speed.
	Click "Run"
