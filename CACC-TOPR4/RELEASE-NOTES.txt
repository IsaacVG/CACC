Whenever a new software version is released, a Release Note is generated to provide the necessary information about bug fixes, new features, workarounds, known issues etc.

RELEASE-NOTES.txt should include some of the following sections:

- Release note identifier (name, date, version #)
CACC VISSIM Algorithm, Oct. 6 2015, Version 1.0


- What's New
First release


- System Requirements (third-party platforms / modules / etc with version numbers / dates)
The CACC VISSIM Algorithm 1.0 can run on most standard Window based computers with 
Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the 
amount of data being read into the software.
Third party platforms: 	PTV VISSIM 6.22 32 or 64 bit
			Microsoft Visual Studio 2013


- Features and changes (new features, defects corrected, caveats etc)

Design the simulation scenarios and modify the scenario.csv file accordingly

More detailed info, please refer to the instruction.txt file.


- Known Issues
VISSIM's lane changing module cannot be easily modified without causing some bad visual effects. So you may see the
left- or right-turning lights always on of the CACC vehicles, but that does not mean they initiated a lane-changing.
